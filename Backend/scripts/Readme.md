# Scripts

These scripts are for testing purposes only (for now). One can use these to populate databases to check if
our functions are working as expected. As David suggested, possibly we can have another service that creates
populates db, but that can be done later. So dont worry to much about them for now, use them to populate dbs if
necessary.
